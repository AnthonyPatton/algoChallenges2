// // Total Unique Ways to Make Change
// Its a dynamic programming question

// You are given an integer array coins representing coins of different denominations and an integer amount representing a total amount of money.

// Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return 0.
